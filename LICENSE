# License

S.P.E.C.T.R.A. is dual-licensed under your choice of:

- Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
- MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

at your option.

## Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be
dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

## Why Dual License?

Dual licensing under Apache-2.0 and MIT provides maximum flexibility:

- **MIT License**: Simple, permissive license that's compatible with almost everything
- **Apache License 2.0**: Includes explicit patent grant and protections

You may choose whichever license best suits your needs. This follows the precedent
set by many Rust projects including the Rust compiler itself.
